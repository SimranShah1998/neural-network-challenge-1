# Student Loan Repayment Prediction Using Neural Networks

## Overview
This project uses a deep neural network to predict whether a borrower will repay their student loan. By analyzing a dataset of student loan recipients, we build, train, and evaluate a machine learning model to classify the likelihood of loan repayment. The model is designed using TensorFlow and Keras and includes data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and prediction steps.

### Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- Data Preparation: Preprocess the dataset to make it suitable for use in a neural network.

- Model Creation: Design, train, and evaluate a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras.

- Prediction: Use the trained model to predict loan repayment success for new data.

- Recommendation System: Discuss the creation of a student loan recommendation system and the challenges involved.

### Dataset

The dataset includes information about previous student loan recipients. Key columns include:

- Payment History: Details about the student’s past repayment patterns.

- Location Parameters: Demographic information about the student.

- Financial Scores: Data about the student’s creditworthiness and debt levels.

- Target Column: credit_ranking, indicating loan repayment likelihood.

The dataset is provided in the file student-loans.csv.

## Technologies Used:

- Python for scripting and data analysis

- Pandas for data preprocessing

- Scikit-learn for data scaling and splitting

- TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the neural network

- Google Colab for cloud-based notebook execution

## Discussion:

The project includes a discussion section on:

- Data required for building a student loan recommendation system.

- Filtering methods (content-based filtering).

- Challenges in implementing a fair and secure recommendation system.
